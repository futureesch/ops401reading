Framework for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. Good first step in instilling trust in your customers.

Key historical points:
In the 1990s, certified public accountants did audits of financial records that came to include reporting on security effectiveness.
2010, AICPA introduced SOC 1 for financial audits and SOC 2. The latter reports are written on audits using the Trust Services Criteria (TSC) standard.

SOC 2 Trust Principles

Security
Confidentiality - protection from unauthorized disclosure
Availability - protection the availability of data/services as agreed upon
Integrity - protection from unauthorized changes
Privacy - collection, use, retention of personal info remains confidential

SOC 2 Common Criteria:

Organization & Management
Communications
Risk Management
Monitoring of Controls
Logical & Physical Access Controls
System Operations
Change Management

The SOC 2 Audit Process

Defined by the AICPA and signed by licensed CPAs.
6 mos - 1 year preparation.
Scoping, Artifact Document Collection, and on-site visit.
Several hours of introductory calls/conversations and 2 days in-person on-prem.

SOC 2 Type 1 - Are all the security controls that are in place today designed properly?

SOC 2 Type 2 - Did the security controls that were in place from January 1 through July 31st operate effectively? Create a system of record. 
Reports on what is actually happening rather than what will happen; this adds value for customers, prospects, board members, partners, insurance companies, etc. 
Processing and/or storing personal data of customers should include a concern for how it is protected and SOC 2 is industry leading and can be the difference between life and death for smaller firms and/or start ups.
While not a guarantee, the framework is respected and valued.

As a vendor, enterprise-scale customers will typically forward questionnaires to assess compliance readiness. By using SOC 2, you are more attractive and place high standards as best practices as an individual professional. 

Improves security by noting security as an ongoing process, not a set it and forget it one-off.
Company culture is boosted after successful completion of these audits; by baking the best practices in from onboarding thru offboarding, deeper sense of trust permeates among employees and outwards.
Creates documentation/records essential for reconstructing the past.
Risk management is addressed head-on, engaging all involved towards mitigating emergent risks.

Smaller companies can get into compliance easier than larger ones, so get going ASAP.
