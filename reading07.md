Data is less secure whilst in motion/transit.

Protecting data at rest and in transit share some tactics: 
Encryption: HTTPS, SSL, TLS, FTPS
Network Security: Firewalls, Network Access Control
Proactive Security
Policies via Data protection solutions: enable user prompting, blocking, or automatic encryption data in transit, whether email message or moved to cloud storage, removable drives, or transferred elsewhere.
Policies via system categorization and classification of company data
Verify what the CSP is providing and remember to remain proactive

Conclusion  “Risk hinges primarily on the sensitivity and value of your data; attackers will attempt to gain access to valuable data whether it’s in motion, at rest, or actively in use, depending on which state is easiest to breach. That’s why a proactive approach including classifying and categorizing data coupled with content, user, and context-aware security protocols is the safest and most effective way to protect your most sensitive data in every state.”
