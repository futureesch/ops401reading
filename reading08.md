Data loss prevention (DLP) tools and processes ensure sensitive data is not lost, misused, or accessed by unauthorized users. DLP software classifies regulated, confidential and business critical data and identifies violations of policies defined by organizations or within a predefined policy pack, typically driven by regulatory compliance such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, or GDPR.

DLP enforces remediation with alerts, encryption, and other protective actions to prevent users from accidental or malicious sharing risks. “Data loss prevention software and tools monitor and control endpoint activities, filter data streams on corporate networks, and monitor data in the cloud to protect data at rest, in motion, and in use.” DLP also provides reporting for compliance and auditing requirements but also to help professionals identify areas of weakness and “anomalies for forensics” and incident response.

Cases for DLP
PII Protection/Compliance - such as healthcare’s HIPPA, DLP can help tag and classify these pieces of data to surround them with protection and meet compliance standards.
Intellectual/Proprietary Info/Property - the bedrock of capitalism, otherwise we have a different economic system of incentives.and safety networks.
Data “Visibility” - As more companies use the cloud, to what extent do you have control over it?
Insider threats, Office 365 security, etc.

Why?
Growth of CISO role
Evolving compliance mandates
More virtual spaces and connections to physical devices
Data breaches are frequent and large
The opportunities and quantity of data to steal is growing
Stolen data is worth a lot of $
The CISO probably lacks a full or complete team as this is a growing need/field as companies who survive into cloud/pandemic life
