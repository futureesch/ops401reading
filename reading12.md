security operations center (SOC), aka an information security operations center (ISOC),  security team monitors, detects, analyzes and responds to cybersecurity incidents, typically on a 24/7/365 basis.

The security team, both security analysts and engineers, oversees servers, databases, networks, applications, endpoint devices, websites and other systems for the sole purpose of pinpointing potential security threats; set an organization’s security posture.

Analyze - investigate the source, report on any vulnerabilities discovered and plan how to for the future. 

On a larger scale, there are also Global Security Operations Centers (GSOC), coordinating security offices that literally span the globe.

Cyber attacks are increasingly damaging to organizations. Confidence is low SOCs assurance looks at grand strategy:

Respond faster: 
Protect consumer and customer trust: 
Additionally, SOC personnel will ensure that you’re using the right tools for your business to their full potential, so you won’t waste money on ineffective tools.

The SOC leads real-time incident response and drives ongoing security improvements to protect the organization from cyber threats. 

“Proactive, around-the-clock surveillance of networks, hardware and software for threat and breach detection, and incident response.
Expertise on all the tools your organization uses, including third-party vendors, to ensure they can easily resolve security issues.
Installation, updating and troubleshooting of application software.
Monitoring and managing of firewall and intrusion prevention systems.
Scanning and remediation of antivirus, malware and ransomware solutions.
Email, voice and video traffic management.
Patch management and whitelisting.
Deep analysis of security log data from various sources.
Analysis, investigation and documentation of security trends.
Investigation of security breaches to understand the root cause of attacks and prevent future breaches.
Enforcement of security policies and procedures.
Backup, storage and recovery.”
What does a SOC do when it’s not detecting threats? 

The SOC is tasked with finding weaknesses — both outside and within the organization — through ongoing software and hardware vulnerability analysis, as well as actively gathering threat intelligence on known risks. 

Most SOCs adopt a hierarchical approach to manage security issues, where analysts and engineers are categorized based on their skill set and experience. A typical team might be structured something like this:

“Level 1 :The first line of incident responders. These security professionals watch for alerts and determine each alert’s urgency as well as when to move it up to Level 2. Level 1 personnel may also manage security tools and run regular reports.
Level 2 :These personnel usually have more expertise, so they can quickly get to the root of the problem and assess which part of the infrastructure is under attack. They will follow procedures to remediate the problem and repair any fallout, as well as flag issues for additional investigation.
Level 3. At this level, personnel consist of high-level expert security analysts who are actively searching for vulnerabilities within the network. They will use advanced threat detection tools to diagnose weaknesses and make recommendations for improving the organization’s overall security. Within this group, you might also find specialists, such as forensic investigators, compliance auditors or cybersecurity analysts.
Level 4: This level consists of high-level managers and chief officers with the most years of experience. This group oversees all SOC team activities and is responsible for hiring and training, plus evaluating individual and overall performance. Level 4s step in during crises, and, specifically, serve as the liaison between the SOC team and the rest of the organization. They are also responsible for ensuring compliance with organization, industry and government regulations.”

What Is the difference between a SOC and a NOC?
NOC, or network operations center, is to ensure that the network performance and speed are up to par and that downtime is limited.

“SOC engineers and analysts search for cyberthreats and attempted attacks, and respond before an organization’s data or systems are compromised. NOC personnel search for any issues that could slow network speed or cause downtime. Both proactively monitor in real-time, with the goal of preventing problems before customers or employees are affected, and search for ways to make continual improvements so that similar issues don’t crop up again.

SOCs and NOCs should collaborate to work through major incidents and resolve crisis situations, and in some cases the SOC functions will be housed within the NOC. NOCs can detect and respond to some security threats, specifically as they pertain to network performance, if the team is properly trained and looking for those threats. A typical SOC wouldn’t have the capability to detect and respond to network performance issues without investing in different tools and skill sets.”

Develop a strategy
Make sure you have visibility across your entire organization: 
Invest in the right tools and services: 
Security information and event management (SIEM): 
Endpoint protection systems
Automated application security
Asset discovery system: 
Data monitoring tool: 
Governance, risk and compliance (GRC) system: 
Vulnerability scanners and penetration testing
Log management system: 
Hire the best and train them well: Your highest-level security analysts should possess these skills:

Ethical hacking: 
Cyber forensics:
Reverse engineering: 
Intrusion prevention system expertise: 

Internal SOCs, usually with a full-time staff based on-premises. The internal SOC comprises a physical room where all the action takes place.

Virtual SOCs are not on-premises, and are made up of part-time or contracted workers who work together in a coordinated manner to resolve issues as needed. The SOC and the organization set parameters and guidelines for how the relationship will work, and how much support the SOC offers can vary depending on the needs of the organization.

Outsourced SOCs, in which some or all functions are managed by an external managed security service provider (MSSP) that specializes in security analysis and response. Sometimes these companies provide specific services to support an internal SOC, and sometimes they handle everything .
