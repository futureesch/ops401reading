History
HD Moore released 1.0, written in Perl, in 2003. From the original 11 exploits more than 1,500 now + 500 payloads. Now written in Ruby.

"Security outfit Rapid7 acquired both Metasploit and Moore in 2009. (Moore left the project in 2016.) Metasploit has since become the de facto framework for exploit development, despite competition from Canvas and Core Impact. Today it is common for zero day reports to include a Metasploit module as proof of concept."

Where to download Metasploit
Metasploit ships as part of Kali Linux, but you can also download it separately at the Metasploit website. Metasploit runs on *nix and Windows systems. The Metasploit Framework source code is available on GitHub.

"Like Coca-Cola, Metasploit comes in different flavors. In addition to the free/libre Metasploit Framework, Rapid7 also produces the Metasploit Community Edition, a free web-based user interface for Metasploit, and Metasploit Pro, the big daddy with the non-free add-ons for pentesters who prefer a GUI or MS Office-like wizards to perform baseline audits, and want to phish their clients as part of an engagement. Rapid7 offers a feature comparison on its website."
