CIS Benchmarks are published by the Center for Internet Security (CIS)
Documented industry best practices for securely configuring IT systems, software, and networks. 
More than 140 CIS Benchmarks in total, spanning across seven core technology categories. 
“CIS Benchmarks are developed through a unique consensus-based process involving communities of cybersecurity professionals and subject matter experts around the world, each of which continuously identifies, refines, and validates security best practices within their areas of focus.”

About:
Established in October 2000. 
“CIS is a global IT community with the common goal of identifying, developing, validating, promoting, and sustaining best practice solutions for cyber defense. 
Over the years, CIS has produced and distributed several free tools and solutions for enterprises of all sizes, designed to strengthen their cybersecurity readiness.”
CIS is most commonly known for its release of CIS Controls - 20 safeguards and countermeasures for effective cyber defense. 
Help organizations reduce risk substantially.

Level 1 Benchmarks - for standard base configurations that have minimal impact on operations

Level 2 Benchmarks - standards for enterprise level configurations that have minimal impact on operations

Operating systems benchmarks - Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Apple OSX. local and remote access restrictions, user profiles, driver installation protocols, and internet browser configurations.
Server software benchmarks - widely used server software, such as Microsoft Windows Server, SQL Server, VMware, Docker, and Kubernetes. Recommendations for configuring Kubernetes PKI certificates, API server settings, server admin controls, vNetwork policies, and storage restrictions.
Cloud provider benchmarks - security configurations for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google, IBM, and other popular public clouds. They include guidelines for configuring identity and access management (IAM), system logging protocols, network configurations, and regulatory compliance safeguards.
Mobile device benchmarks - mobile operating systems, including iOS and Android, and focus on areas such as developer options and settings, OS privacy configurations, browser settings, and app permissions.
Network device benchmarks - general and vendor-specific security configuration guidelines for network devices and applicable hardware from Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, Juniper, and others.
Desktop software benchmarks - security configurations for some desktop software applications, including Microsoft Office and Exchange Server, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari Browser. Focus on email privacy and server settings, mobile device management, default browser settings, and third-party software blocking.
Multi-function print device benchmarks - configuring multi-function printers in office settings and firmware updating, TCP/IP configurations, wireless access configuration, user management, and file sharing.

CIS Hardened Images

CIS pre-configured Hardened Images enable enterprises to perform computing operations cost-effectively without needing to invest in additional hardware or software. Hardened images are more secure than standard virtual images by limiting vulnerabilities.

Hardened Images designed and configured in compliance with CIS Benchmarks Controls
Recognized to be fully compliant with various regulatory compliance organizations. 
CIS Hardened Images are widely available and easy to deploy across many CSPs.

CIS Benchmarks and regulatory compliance

“CIS Benchmarks align closely with–or 'map to'—security and data privacy regulatory frameworks including:”
the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Cybersecurity Framework, 
the PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) (PCI DSS), 
HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), 
ISO/EIC 2700. 
Any organization operating in an industry governed by these types of regulations can make significant progress toward compliance by adhering to CIS Benchmarks. 

Benefits of CIS Benchmarks
While enterprises are always free to make their own choices around security configurations, CIS Benchmarks recommendations offer the following:

Expertise of a global community of professionals.
Regularly updated, step-by-step guidance for securing every area of the IT infrastructure.
Compliance management consistency.
A flexibility template for securely adopting new cloud services and for executing digital transformation strategies.
Easy-to-deploy configurations for improved operational efficiency and sustainability.
