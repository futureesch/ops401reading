I should probably investigate an online program for information assurance in addition to certifications as a means to leverage opportunities and payscale. The certs to consider:

OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)
CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)
GCIH (GIAC Certified Incident Handler)
CISA (Certified Information Security Auditor)
CISSP-ISSEP (Information Systems Security Engineering Professional)
CISSP-ISSAP (Information Systems Security Architecture Professional)
CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)
CISSP-ISSMP ((Information Systems Security Management Professional)

I’m confident my ability to focus will rise with my increased understanding of the field. This includes acquiring the ability to enhance their cyber threat hunting by using Indicators of Compromise (IoC) to facilitate proactive defense. 

Are we going to be introduced to visual link analysis tools?

I have the Elements of Style, and taught historical research writing, which is some of the most rigorous academic writing outside of the material sciences, so I feel good about communication.

Implementation is another strength of mine. I have rudimentary Spanish that should be spruced up. 

Big-picture views and strategic thinking is fun for me. Civilization has been a favorite of mine for the essential strategy beyond the military units. 

I hope to get good at data analysis quickly. Getting into the hacker mindset has been more challenging than I thought as my general good-nature inhibits my dastardly creativity, but like a broken floodgate, I’m about to burst.

Emphasis on “fileless” threats. Microsoft Powershell is an attack surface reached through social engineering campaigns and techniques. To be able to evaluate Powershell, the first thing a sysadmin can enable is Module Logging which records specific actions executed using Powershell. If it fits the situation, script-based logging can be enabled. A transcription log can generate basic sessions, but lacks the ability to record specific commands invoked.
Parsing logs from Powershell can be voluminous since a single cmdlet could trigger well over 30 events.  Trend Micro developed Rule 1010002 - Microsoft PowerShell Command Execution to provide security professionals with more tools to uncover exploits and threats with more speed to reduce impact and ongoing risk.
