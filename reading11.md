Cybersecurity will increasingly mean automation of repetitive, time-consuming tasks so that organizations can focus on problem-solving or innovating. As threat attackers become more pervasive, so too will the need to deploy automation tooling solutions

Vulnerability management products always need to be configured
automatically detect and scan devices on an enterprise network.
conduct an assessment based upon security controls authorized by the organization
Complete assessment should indicate identified defects to be remediated.

Tools - security automation and orchestration (SOAR) products, robotic process automation (RPA), and custom-developed software and code that automate processes and perform analysis.

The Why

As businesses transition more of their work digitally, technical complexity enterprise affects the work organizations perform, interact, compete, and so on. Significant risk environment by failing to properly defend, monitor and respond to threats.

Automation helps teams identify threats by taking the humans out of the threat detection, instead moving that into automation, so that we can respond. The more we can automate to save ourselves time to be creative so as to improve overall security posture.

7 Scenarios Highlights:

“One of your users interacts with a malicious IP address. You need to update your firewall to block the IP.” - automation can be put in place to isolate the site and remember to block it/redirect users.
“One of your systems has been infected with malware. You need to limit the damage and find out how many systems are vulnerable before it spreads.” - helps shorten to-do and with a SOAR, tooling expedites analysis and remediation.
“You’ve contained a breach, but what was the scope of the damage? Whether for compliance purposes or just to understand what happened, you need to investigate.” -SOARs help with aggregation of data to provide advanced filtering to reveal bigger patterns and clearer pictures of what is taking place
“One of your systems interacts with a Command & Control server for a remote administration tool (RAT). You need to block any further communication with the malicious domain.” - Great way to isolate the malicious server from being accessed by others on the network and/or otherwise breaching the network at-large
“Breaking news: New ransomware has emerged that exploits a vulnerability in a common Operating System. You need to know if your systems are vulnerable and, if so, take action.” - A product that builds actionable threat intelligence updates into your security plan can ensure you’re up-to-date to detect new vulnerabilities and threats without needing to do your own research and setting up your own threat detection rules.
“A breach occurs in one of your environments. You have a team of people handling the investigation, but you (and they) need to keep track of the incident response activities they’re taking on.” -Some solutions include tools to help keep track of incident response efforts
“You detect ransomware activity on a server storing critical customer data – and the alarm occurs in the middle of the night.” -Automation can be used to respond without waking you up, or if that’s part of your job, it can be configured to do so.
