Sniffing monitors and captures all data packets passing through a given network. Used by network/system administrator to monitor and troubleshoot network traffic. Attackers use sniffers to capture data enabling their objectives. Can be hardware or software installed in the system. "By placing a packet sniffer on a network in promiscuous mode, a malicious intruder can capture and analyze all of the network traffic."

Active Sniffing:
SWTICH. A switch is a point to point network device. The switch regulates the flow of data between its ports by actively monitoring the MAC address on each port, which helps it pass data only to its intended target. 

Passive Sniffing:
HUB. Any traffic that is passing through the non-switched or unbridged network segment can be seen by all machines on that segment. Sniffers operate at the data link layer of the network. Any data sent across the LAN is actually sent to each and every machine connected to the LAN. Passive since sniffers placed by the attackers passively wait for the data to be sent and capture them.
