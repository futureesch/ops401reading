A story of CapitalOne’s misconfiguration of AWS. A devastating breach that Cloudneeti believes
“can be avoided when organizations deploy tools to enforce continuous compliance
with cloud security best practices.”

The post-mortem reviewed the attack and labelled it an SSRF attack using AWS metadata service. An SSRF attack is Server-Side Request Forgery whereby an attacker gains access via misconfiguration or vulnerability exploited on the target server. 

Six AWS governance practices amounting to constant monitoring, least use privilege, and CIA triad help to administer robust security. There are almost 20 AWS Configurations Cloudneeti further recommends for implementation to avoid a breach like CapitalOne’s. 

Infrastructure as Code automation helps bring some of these configurations and practices into an automated space to help SOCs and CIRTs maintain their best security posture. Further help via auto-remediation assists teams in deviations within the system.
