Components of Security and Risk Management crucial for CISSP 
(Certified Information Systems Security Professional):

Information security within the organization / Security Model
The triad of information security – Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability
Security governance principles
Business continuity requirements
Policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines
Risk management concepts
Threat modeling

Security Goals
“Have controls in place to support the mission of the organization.
All the decisions should be based on risk tolerance of organization, cost and benefit.”

From strategy to tactics; from tactics to operations

Planning Horizon

(DAILY) Operational goals may include supporting users, their endpoints as it relates to their UX
(MID-TERM) Tactical goals may include joining endpoints to a domain, firewall, and network segmentation to develop more centralized control over the network
(LONG-TERM) The strategic goal may be to have a networked domain connection via VPN and RADIUS servers

Confidentiality:

Social Engineering: Training and awareness, defining Separation of Duties at the tactical level, enforcing policies and conducting Vulnerability Assessments

Media Reuse: Proper Sanitization Strategies

Eavesdropping: Use of encryption and keeping sensitive information off the network with adequate access controls

Integrity

Encryption – Integrity based algorithms
Intentional or Malicious Modification
Message Digest (Hash)
MAC
Digital Signatures

Availability

Prevent single point of failure
Comprehensive fault tolerance (Data, Hard Drives, Servers, Network Links, etc.)

Best Practices:

Separation of Duties - decentralize human control as a preventative control
Mandatory Vacations - detective control - see what someone’s area looks like while they are gone and you’re running it
Least privilege - users only have access to what they need
Need to know - classifying info
Dual Control - requiring more than one user to complete a task (like in those spy sequences in shows)

Risk Management

The risk management lifecycle includes all risk-related actions such as Assessment, Analysis, Mitigation, and Ongoing Risk Monitoring

Security Governance

“To achieve security governance, security blueprints have to be created to allow organizations to implement practices and procedures to support their security goals and the overall mission of the organizations. Various industry consortiums have provided insight into the goals, objectives, and means of developing successful Information Security Management Systems (ISMS).”

Hierarchies are cheaper than heterarchies and more effective as the latter tend to be doomed from the start.
